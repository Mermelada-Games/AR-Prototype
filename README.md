# 🏌️‍♂️ AR MiniGolf

**AR MiniGolf** is an Augmented Reality (AR) mini-golf experience where **you design the course**. Use physical references in the real world to define the layout, and then use your mobile device as a golf club to hit the ball into the hole.

## 🎮 How to Play

### 1. Place the References  
Set up the physical reference objects in your environment to define the corners and edges of your custom mini-golf course.

### 2. Scan the References  
Use your mobile device to scan each reference in the order you want. The game will use this sequence to create a unique course layout.

### 3. Generate the Ball and the Hole  
Once the course is set, tap on your screen to place the starting ball and the hole anywhere within your AR setup.

### 4. Press "Start"  
Hit the **Start** button to begin playing. Your phone becomes the golf club — swing it gently to strike the virtual ball and guide it into the hole!
